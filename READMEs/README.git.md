2-To work on something new, create a branch off frommaster and given a descriptively name(ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
3-Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
4-When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
